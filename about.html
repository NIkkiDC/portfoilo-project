              I recently began my coding journey back in December 2021. I fell
              in love with the idea of being able to create something from
              scratch. I started my coding career with YouTube videos which
              further inspired me to invest in certification courses.
              Javascript, taught me the foundational skills of coding while I
              was able to expand on the skills I learned with SheCodes.
              SheCodes, a boot camp geared to kickstart tech careers for women
              engineers, allowed me to develop my first tangible projectâ€”a
              weather application. The ability to create my first webpage from
              the front end sparked an excitement that I had never felt before.
              I yearned for that feeling each day, and the curiosity to
              understand the language's rationale propelled me to dive deeper
              into HTML and Javascript for a more critical understanding.
              However, I executed the same due diligence with my most recent
              project, my portfolio site, with more functions, given my recent
              experiences. I am eager to diversify my repertoire; nonetheless, I
              am immensely proud of the work I have already accomplished.
